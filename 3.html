  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of
    presentation and content, including aspects such as the
    layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
    content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
    control in the specification of presentation character
    istics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting
    by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
    content.
    Separation of formatting and content makes it possible
    to present the same markup page in different styles for
    different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
    by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also
    display the web page differently depending on the screen
    size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a
    different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored
    on their own computer, to override the one the author
    specified.
